# Terms and definitions 

[[toc]]

## Overview

Like all applications, Multipass uses a specific language & concepts.

## Team

Teams are _the_ core of Multipass. Each Team has his own database inside Multipass. Everything is bound to a single Team. You can however below to several Teams, with different roles. 

A Team usualy contains several Team Members, working together; but you can create your own personal Team. 

A Team can be anything, including:
- a group of people working together on in a society
- a small company
- your personal team containing your own family data and relationships
- and much much more

## Model
I will use the term `Model` when talking _about piece that holds data_. That means that you can substitute the word for every node of data Multipass has in that context. be it a `Contact`, `Label`, 'Human', .. 

Model is a programmatic term and somewhat synonymous with `object`

## Displayname 

To identify each `Model` in your Team, you are _required_ to give them a `displayname` that is unique. This name is shown inside Multipass on all the lists, select boxes and other UI elements.

## App
The different parts of Multipass are defined by different apps. An App bundles specific functionality to achieve a certain goal.
