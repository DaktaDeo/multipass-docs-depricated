## What is Multipass?

Multipass is a new Bussiness Intelligence App with a Twist. Multipass takes the pain and hassle out of managing a small bussiness and can even be used to manage you association. It does not matter if you want to manage your own Team, have a full fledged Boat Price Calculator, organize a Soccer Tournament or just have a tool that handles your CRM data with flexibility - Multipass is the solution for you.

After creating you Team you have instant access to all the available apps, including:

- [Contacts](/app_contacts) 
- Automatic Security & Feature Updates
- And much more!

## Browser Support 

Multipass should work in any web-kit based modern browser.

:::warning Limitations during the Beta period 

Due to limited resources of our dev-team we recommend Vivaldi, Brave or Google Chrome. These are the browsers we use to develop/test the app and are therefore guaranteed to work best.

## Mobile Support
During the beta **our main focus is having a fully working app on desktop**. We do however ‚ù§ our iPhone, and hate not being able to access/add info on the road! üå≤

You can count on it that, **at the very least the most essential features things will work on an iphone SE 2020**. Like seeing contact info or calling them directly from the list. Sometimes with a bit of compromises like using landscape mode or manual clicking on 'hide' for the sidebar.

:::warning Limitations during the Beta period
Cutoff device is an 11-inch iPad pro 202 (M1); using Brave iOS. Used in Landscape mode. Basic feature set & usable with sometimes UI work-arounds.

## Multipass API

Forge provides a powerful API that allows you to access your Team's data programatically, providing access to constant growing Multipass features. At this time access to the API is on a case-by-case base. Contact Veerle for more information.
